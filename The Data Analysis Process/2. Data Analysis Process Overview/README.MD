# Data Analysis Process Overview
We usually organize data analysis process in to five steps as follows:

# step 1 - Ask Questions

<p>Whether you're presented with data and formulate questions derived from it or pose inquiries initially and subsequently collect data, the efficacy of your analysis hinges on posing insightful questions. Exceptional questions assist in pinpointing pertinent aspects of the data, steering your analysis toward valuable insights. It's common to revisit this step multiple times throughout the analysis process.</p>

# step 2 Wrangle data

<p>You acquire the necessary data in a manipulable format through a three-step process: collecting, evaluating, and refining. Essentially, this involves:

1. Collecting the data essential for addressing your inquiries.
2. Evaluating the data to detect any issues pertaining to its quality or structure.
3. Refining the data by making adjustments, replacements, or removals to guarantee that your dataset attains optimal quality and structure.
</p>

# Step 3: Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

<p>You investigate and enhance your data to optimize the effectiveness of your analyses, visualizations, and models. Exploration entails identifying patterns within your data and illustrating the relationships present. Following exploration, actions such as eliminating outliers and refining features, also referred to as feature engineering, can be performed.</p>

# Step 4: Draw conclusions

<p> This phase typically involves the application of advanced techniques like machine learning or inferential statistics, which go beyond the content covered in this course. For those seeking a deeper understanding of such methods, consider exploring the Data Scientist Nanodegree.

Within this course, the emphasis is placed on reaching conclusions through descriptive statistics and data visualizations. </p>

# Step 5: Communicate your results

Frequently, it is necessary to provide rationale and articulate the significance of the insights you have discovered. Alternatively, if your ultimate objective is to develop a system, it is typically essential to communicate details about what you have constructed, elucidate the decision-making process in design, and present an evaluation of its performance. Various methods exist for conveying your outcomes, such as reports, slide presentations, blog posts, emails, verbal presentations, and discussions. The fundamental principles of data visualization, which you will learn in this course, will always prove highly valuable in this context.
